In this project, we decided to try an NLP Task (Emotion Classification).

The dataset are gathered from Twitter API that is filtered by using some hashtags which are representing Sundanese emotion. These are the hashtags :
 #persib, #corona, #saredih,
#nyakakak, #garoblog, #sangsara, #gumujeng, #bungah,
#sararieun, #ceurik, and #hariwang.

There are 4 emotions in this dataset, which are :
1. anger
2. joy
3. fear
4. sadness

We will use Random Forest as a baseline model in this project, and use another method as comparison.
